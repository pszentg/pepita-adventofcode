Guides &amp; solutions for the yearly challenge at https://adventofcode.com/ 

## Python
### Get started
* First, you'll need a development environment, for Python most people either use [PyCharm from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC) 
or [VSCode from Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I personally prefer PyCharm, this section of the guide assumes you'll be using it.
* To set up this project, follow the rest of the guide [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html#checkout-from-vcs)

Read more about how VCSes work [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control). 
You can also read about the built-in VCS for PyCharm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-git-integration.html).

### Documentation and guides
Python is arguably one of the most beautifully documented programming languages existing, therefore I highly suggest reading
their [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.11/tutorial/index.html). Most of the problems you will try to solve here can be
solved using purely their documentation.

If you're curious how general progression in learning Pything should look like and what other topics should you next read up on, you can find a comprehensible decision tree [here](https://roadmap.sh/python)
